# Basic C++: References

References can be extremely confusing, especially when trying to understand the differences between them and pointers.
If you have a solid understanding of how pointers work, and you understand what the const keyword does, references are much easier to grasp.
For those who do understand references, they can be very convenient to use.
This example shows the basic syntax for references, and shows basic uses of them.
